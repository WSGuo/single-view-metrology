# Single View Metrology
CV project COMP5421
# proj3
In this assignment we create 3D texture-mapped models from a single image using the single view modeling method.

The basic idea comes from the original paper "Single View Metrology," by Criminisi, Reid, and Zisserman, ICCV 99.

The steps of the project are:

Image acquisition
Calculate vanishing points
Choose reference points
Compute textures and 3-D positions and create a VRML model
Submit results
