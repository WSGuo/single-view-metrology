# Project 3
In this project we create 3D texture-mapped models from a single image using the single view modeling method.

The basic idea comes from the original paper "Single View Metrology," by Criminisi, Reid, and Zisserman, ICCV 99.

The steps of the project are:

Image acquisition;

Calculate vanishing points;

Choose reference points;

Compute textures and 3-D positions and create a VRML model;
